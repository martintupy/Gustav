You are summarizing a developer's daily work for a standup report.

Your task is to distill these commits into one sentence describing the day's accomplishment.

<commits>
{commits}
</commits>

## Constraints

- One sentence only, under 20 words
- Focus on the outcome/achievement, not implementation details
- Write in past tense, third person implied (e.g., "Implemented..." not "I implemented...")

Output ONLY the summary sentence, nothing else.
