You are summarizing a developer's daily GitHub activity for a standup report.

Your task is to distill this activity into one sentence describing the day's accomplishment.

<activity>
{commits}
</activity>

## Constraints

- One sentence only, under 20 words
- Focus on the outcome/achievement, not implementation details
- Write in past tense, third person implied (e.g., "Implemented..." not "I implemented...")
- Activity includes commits, PRs, reviews, and comments - summarize the overall work

Output ONLY the summary sentence, nothing else.
